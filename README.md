# Kotlin-Projects

This repository is a collection of my work and practice throughout the Development in JVM Languages course, where I explored the Kotlin programming language. It includes assignments, exercises, and small projects that I completed to better understand Kotlin’s syntax, features, and real-world applications.

I’m using this repository as a way to learn by doing. The code here may not be perfect — and that’s intentional — it reflects my growth as I experiment, debug, and learn to write more efficient and expressive Kotlin code.

What’s Inside

Practice Exercises – Small tasks focused on learning Kotlin fundamentals.

Projects – Larger applications that combine multiple concepts and techniques.

Notes – Short explanations, experiments, and reflections from the learning process.
